## Quick Reference

- Ecotone is a PHP framework for message-driven architecture (DDD, CQRS, Event Sourcing)
- Use PHP 8.1+ attributes: #[CommandHandler], #[EventHandler], #[QueryHandler]
- Test with EcotoneLite::bootstrapForTesting()
- No comments in code - use descriptive method names instead
- Documentation: https://docs.ecotone.tech

## Code Style

- PHP 8.1+ features (attributes, enums, named arguments)
- All public APIs need @param/@return PHPDoc
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Messages (Commands, Events, Queries) are first-class citizens

## Testing

Run tests inside Docker container:
```bash
docker exec -it -u root ecotone_development /bin/bash
cd packages/PackageName
composer tests:ci
```
