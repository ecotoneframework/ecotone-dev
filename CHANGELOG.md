## [1.202.0] - 2023-10-24

# What's Changed
This is huge release, it includes changes to how Messaging System is built and used.
This is how Messaging System is going to behave now:

- **Collecting** -  At first we want to collect the configuration in form of objects that can be dumped. This means there should no references to any Resources that may hold connection to anything external. Therefore objects are serializable and we can dump for caching purposes. This does not change.
- **Dumping** -  As all configuration can be dumped, it can also be described as form of Dependency Container Definitions. This way we we can move all the configuration to Dependency Container. Thanks to that we are using full container optimalizations. 
This is recent change in Ecotone introduced by @jlabedo, previously whole configuration was cached and restored all together ❤️.
- **Executing** -  When configuration is dumped as separate definitions in DI, we can now pull only ones that are needed. This means we come to do ultimate optimization of building and executing only components that are needed in given flow.
Before all components were fetched and connected together at run time (yet in a lazy way).

## [1.200.0] - 2023-10-23

### This version is not yet production ready. Please wait for `1.201.0` for production ready release :)

## What's Changed

This is huge release, it includes changes to how Messaging System is built and used. 
This is how Messaging System is going to behave now:
1. **Collecting** - At first we want to collect the configuration in form of objects that can be dumped. This means there should no references to any Resources that may hold connection to anything external. Therefore objects are serializable and we can dump for caching purposes. This does not change.
2. **Dumping** -  As all configuration can be dumped, it can also be described as form of **Dependency Container Definitions**. This way we we can move all the configuration to Dependency Container. Thanks to that we are using full container optimalizations. 
This is recent change in Ecotone introduced by @jlabedo, previously whole configuration was cached and restored all together ❤️.
3. **Executing** - When configuration is dumped as separate definitions in DI, we can now pull only ones that are needed. This means we come to do ultimate optimization of building and executing only components that are needed in given flow.
Before all components were fetched and connected together at run time (yet in a lazy way).
