# Refactor To Reactive System

This Demo shows how can we refactor common PHP feature to Message Driven architecture.  

- Stage_1 - non message-driven architecture, handles data change and side effects synchronously.
- Stage_2 - message-driven architecture, handles data change synchronously and side effects asynchronously  
- Stage_2 - Command Handler Aggregate  

This is example implementation for the article describing [Reactive Systems in PHP](https://blog.ecotone.tech/building-reactive-message-driven-systems-in-php/).
